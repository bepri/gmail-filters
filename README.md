# Gmail Filter Generator
This tool reads in a config file specifying email filters and generates an XML
file that can be imported into Gmail. This removes the meticulous process of
defining and organizing email filters within the Gmail client, which cares
about the order you declare filters but does not give you the option to
reorder them.
